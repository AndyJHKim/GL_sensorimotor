reg = regressor
ts = raw timeseries
nts = normalized timeseries
rts = regressed out timeseries (residuals of OLS, only nuisance regressors are regressed out)

??s = network-wise sorted. A sorted corr.npy is a square 2D array. For example, 09s in /Users/clmn/Desktop/GL_FS/GLFS02/connectivity/correlations/Shen268/09/09s.FB.group.main.002.

int = intersection
